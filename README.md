## A suite of functions to distill files and eliminate folders and mine your best unshared work

### Status: Early days. Very sketchy and prototypey. 

### Experiential Aim: To transform the chore of sifting your mountainous personal backlog into a creatively productive daily practice.
To make your dull file trees in to a curated storage gallery. To route your best thoughts into channels where they contribute to open projects. 

### Rationale: Excellent creative work is built on layers of rich knowledge and experience, on experimenting playfully, and staying engaged in your craft. 

### How to participate: Coming soon
